        | This site is for rising YouTubers who are not seeing
        | their videos coming up on top of YouTube's search results.
        | YouTube allows you to search by the number of views,
        | or by the upload date. By default it shows you 'relevant'
        | results. None of these criteria work well for new content
        | unless your videos are about what everyone wants to see.
        | Which means - it is incredibly hard for new kind of content
        | to get noticed. This site offers you a way to search YouTube
        | for a combination of upload date and view count. That way
        | you can see which other videos launched at the same time
        | as yours have the most views. This might help you understand
        | how to increase your video's view count.
